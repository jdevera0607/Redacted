An option for a project that I have thought about is something simple but with a slight twist. I want to create an online store that requires an account to purchase anything from the store and has an optional subscription that provides buyers with a discount.

I decided to go with this route because there is a trend that some big businesses implement this system. I am familiar with a local business that has a simple implementation of this system and would like to see if I am capable of making improvements of my own accord (I will not state this business). I co-own a business and would like to see whether this idea would provide financial gain and whether consumers would be willing to pay a subscription for discounts.

I would like to explore whether :

flat percentage discounts as a whole, or per item would be more beneficial.

What are the downsides of providing subscription-based discounts to a consumer? 

How does it benefit the business?

I do feel that this is an arduous process due to having to have multiple prices for a single item, having revolving data that keeps track of customers whether they do or do not have a subscription, and making sure discounts are applied properly without driving the business down.
